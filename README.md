ps1
---

My PowerShell script collection. Backup and sharing.

## Highlights

[Init-Ramdisk.ps1](Init-Ramdisk.ps1) - Use imdisk without third-party tools

[Install-RdpCert.ps1](Install-RdpCert.ps1) - Saves the hassle when updating my RDP certificate (by LE) every three months

[Rename-Arxiv.ps1](Rename-Arxiv.ps1) - No longer in use, I have switched to a proper open source reference manager :)
